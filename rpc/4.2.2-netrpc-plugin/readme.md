Here is the new protoc command you should use:
protoc \
  --plugin=protoc-gen-go-netrpc=./main \
  --proto_path=.. \
  --go-netrpc_out=plugins=abc:. \
  ../protobuf/hellopb/hello.proto

1. Change for: func (p *netrpcPlugin) Name() string { return "abc" }
This Go function defines the internal name of the plugin, which is passed as a parameter to the generator.
What you need to change: The plugins= value inside the --go-netrpc_out flag.
Old: plugins=netrpc
New: plugins=abc
This tells your running main program to activate the plugin that registered itself with the name "abc".

2. Change for: The executable is named main
protoc automatically looks for an executable named protoc-gen- + [flag_name]. In your case, because you use --go-netrpc_out, it looks for protoc-gen-go-netrpc. Since your file is just named main, this automatic search will fail.

You must explicitly tell protoc where to find the executable using the --plugin flag.
What you need to change: Add a --plugin flag to map the expected name to the actual file.
The format is: --plugin=[expected_name]=[path_to_actual_file]

Your specific flag: --plugin=protoc-gen-go-netrpc=./main

This flag says: "Hey protoc, when you need the go-netrpc generator, don't search for it. Instead, run the file named main located in the current directory (./)."

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
where is flag_name defined in the code you provided in protoc-gen-go-netrpc.go ?
That is an excellent and very important question. It highlights a key concept that can be confusing.

The flag_name (like go-netrpc in your case) is not defined anywhere in the Go code.
It is an implicit convention determined by the protoc compiler based on the command-line flag you use.

Here is the rule protoc follows:
You provide a flag that ends with _out. For example: protoc --XYZ_out=...
protoc takes the part before _out (which is XYZ in this example) and considers that the flag_name.
protoc then automatically constructs the name of the executable it needs to find and run by prepending protoc-gen-. So, it will look for an executable file named protoc-gen-XYZ.

Let's apply this to your specific case:
You use the command-line flag: --go-netrpc_out
protoc sees this and determines the flag_name is go-netrpc.
Therefore, protoc searches for an executable program named protoc-gen-go-netrpc.
This is why, when your executable was named main, the automatic search failed, and you had to explicitly tell protoc where to find it using the --plugin flag:
--plugin=protoc-gen-go-netrpc=./main

The Critical Distinction
It is vital to separate these two concepts:

>Executable Name (from flag_name): This is how protoc finds and runs your plugin program. It's determined by the --[flag_name]_out argument. It is external to your Go code.

>Plugin Name (from Name() function): This is how your Go program identifies an internal plugin to activate. It's determined by the plugins= parameter. It is internal to your Go code.
